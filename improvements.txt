1. Improve health check time when there are more than 20 targets - optimize it
2. What if the server crashes, asynchronolously write config of servers into disk/DB
3. Create option to add more targets dynamically - auto scaling... Have a separate service to monitor CPU/Memory/Disk or whatever the trigger is
4. Add Logging
6. Option to add custom headers 
8. Add support for algorithms like least number of connections and least response time.
9. Graceful shutdown.
10. Optimize handling of incoming requests. - connection pooling
11. Return the response from the upstream target - done
12. Improve the storage mechanism making it persistent
13. Add UUID to request for traceability - done
15. Sticky sessions
16. request metric integration
17. configurable request timeout, retries
18. handling errors Gracefully
19. Authentication - X 
20. ACL - X
21. Metrics
22. Certificate termination 
23. Scheduling - X
24. Handle request transformation - Header/data transformation
25. real time sync
26 . distributed system ready
